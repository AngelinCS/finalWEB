The initual results show that performance of the website are well done. Accessibility is pretty good but should be higher to prevent any lawsuits, Best Pratcies we got a good resil and finally SEO was by far the lowest at 80 points. Since this is not Progressive Web Application (PWA) we didnt get  a result.
